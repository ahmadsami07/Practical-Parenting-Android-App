Practical-Parenting-Android-App - completed as a class project

An android application that lets users, namely parents, schedule tasks, enforce timeouts and add some respite to their daily lives. 

It has various features, which include an option where you can add your list of children, and assign a picture for each. 
Also, the parent can add a list of tasks, which will cycle between the children letting them know which child's turn it is for doing the particular chore. There is also a timeout timer that works as an alarm using android service functions. It sends a notification once a child's timeout has finished. The application also has a "breathe in, breathe out" feature, that lets users hold a circle inside the app, and the animated circle inflates like a balloon.

Here is a screenshot of the app's main menu:
